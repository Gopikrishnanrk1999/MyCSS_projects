        <p>Newly single freelance writer Nina isn’t exactly flourishing, especially after she has to move back in with her depressed brother and her overbearing mother. But when she finds herself reading a self-help book in jail on her 30th birthday (long story), she embarks on a journey toward self-love, learning lessons most of us could stand to hear, too.</p>

With everything from a cosmic search for home to a theme park for terminally ill kids and a talking pig, it’s a lyrical adventure that feels fantastical yet familiar.</p>

        <p>Provocative, fast-paced and darkly funny, this irreverent novel follows controversial folk singer Aviva Rosner through her shocking album release to mixed reviews, international tours and fertility struggles as she tries to reconcile her own longing for a baby with her distrust of technological intervention. It's an energizing read for anyone who's ever been told, "Oh, you're just on your period," albeit a challenging one.</p>
