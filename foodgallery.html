        <h1>Laksa</h1>
        <p>A spicy, sweet, sour and fragrant soup from Southeast Asia, laksa is mostly associated with Malaysia. The origins are murky with several theories in different countries and a wide range of laksa exist, from regional varieties to differences in preparation. Typically, either a rich and spicy coconut milk broth or a sour asam broth made with tamarind, the soup is made with thick wheat noodles or rice vermicelli and served with chicken, prawn or fish.</p>

        <h1>Beef Wellington</h1>
        <p>A dish that's fallen out of favour and then become popular again more times than we can count, beef Wellington's origins are as unclear as its connection to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Traditionally, it's a beef fillet steak, coated in pâté and mushroom duxelles (an extremely finely chopped mixture of mushrooms, shallots and herbs), wrapped in puff pastry, then baked. Its modern-day popularity is largely thanks to Gordon Ramsay who's made it one of his signature dishes.</p>

        <h1>Gua bao</h1>
        <p>The popularity of bao buns has skyrocketed in the Western world in the last decade or so and while these steamed buns are Chinese in origin, it's the Taiwanese version that's proved to be the most popular. A traditional gua bao consists of slices of pork belly meat dressed with pickled mustard greens, coriander and ground peanuts.</p>

        <h1>Bouillabaisse</h1>
        <p>Bouillabaisse is synonymous with the South of France, especially the port city of Marseille, and is a wonderful celebration of sea creatures caught just off the coast. The soup is made with a selection of spices and Provençal herbs as well as heady saffron. Various fish and shellfish are then added at different times to cook in the broth. In Marseille the broth is traditionally served separate from the seafood with slices of bread and rouille (a sauce of olive oil, breadcrumbs, garlic, saffron and cayenne pepper) on the side.</p>
